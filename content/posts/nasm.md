I just did a quick semi-deep dive into learning assembly!

Why?  Because [revolutionizing computer programming](https://revolutionize.dev/)
is a high priority for me, and I no longer trust the wobbling tower of
poorly-designed abstractions that modern computing is built upon.

Will revolutionizing programming require the replacement of the most
fundamental abstractions we make, such as the function?

I think that might just be the case.  (At the very least we should make
functions extensible _without breaking backward compatibility_ by
having each function accept exactly 1 parameter that is an object or
struct; more on that another time.)  Therefore, learning assembly can
help me bypass all of that.

When it comes to learning NASM and assembly, here's a tutorial I'm
loving so far: https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/ .
