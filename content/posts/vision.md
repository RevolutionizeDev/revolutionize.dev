## Software is broken.

### Revolutionize.dev exists to fix it.

We are a distributed R&D lab with a bold vision for how the global
developer community can move beyond today's "best practices" -- the
broken status quo of the software world.


### What Software Must Become

The world desperately needs us all to become _dramatically_ better at
architecting software that is:


#### Simple

Software should be brilliantly simple, not brilliantly complex.


#### Composable

We should be able to seamlessly combine different pieces of software
without modifying those pieces
([example](https://github.com/gliderlabs/stdcom)).


#### Extensible

In the near future, software must become easy to extend the
capabilities of _without_ modifying existing code
([example](https://github.com/progrium/go-extpoints)).


#### Backward-compatible

_"Thou shalt not break working code."_
--[jwz](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2012/06/i-have-ported-xscreensaver-to-the-iphone/)


#### Secure

Preventing the hostile takeover of the world's digital infrastructure
should not be an afterthought.


#### High-leverage

Don't do less with less, _definitely_ don't do more with more;
instead, _do more with less_.

We can achieve all of this and more by following
[our guiding principles](/principles).

(Performance and useful features are important, but there are market
forces ensuring that these continue to be valued; that which is
obvious is not worth emphasizing.)
