## Software is broken.

### Revolutionize.dev exists to fix it.

We are a distributed R&D lab with many ideas for how to improve "best
practices" -- the broken status quo of the software world.


### What Software Must Do

The world desperately needs us all to become _dramatically_ better at
architecting software that is:

* **Simple**
  * Aim for _brilliantly simple, not brilliantly complex_

* **Composable**
  * We should be able to seamlessly combine different pieces of software without modifying those pieces ([example](https://github.com/gliderlabs/stdcom))

* **Extensible**
  * In the near future, software must become easy to extend the capabilities of _without_ modifying existing code ([example](https://github.com/progrium/go-extpoints))

* **Backward-compatible**
  * _"Thou shalt not break working code."_ --[jwz](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2012/06/i-have-ported-xscreensaver-to-the-iphone/)

* **Secure**
  * Preventing the hostile takeover of the world's digital infrastructure should not be an afterthought

* **High-leverage**
  * Don't do less with less, _definitely_ don't do more with more; instead, _do more with less_

We can achieve all of this and more by following our [principles](/principles).

(Performance and useful features are important, and there are market
forces ensuring that these remain important; that which is obvious is
not worth emphasizing.)
