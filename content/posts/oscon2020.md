## We're speaking at OSCON this year!

Check out the upcoming talk by our founder, Steve Phillips, on July 15th at
[OSCON 2020](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or) in Portland:
**["The Great Translation and the Age of V"](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/84047)**.


#### Talk Abstract

> If the software industry can master the quite feasible task of
translating code between arbitrary pairs of programming languages,
this will unleash vast potential that many of us have dreamt of for
decades: use any functionality from any language or environment, allow
new programming languages to start from where the same baseline,
rewrite all the world's unsafe code in safe languages, and more!
